                India Kawasaki Motors Pvt. Ltd. is a subsidiary of Kawasaki Motors Limited, Japan. The Indian journey of
                Kawasaki began in 2009 with the launch of Ninja 650 and Ninja 250.
                On 1st July 2010, India Kawasaki Motors Pvt. Ltd. (IKM) was incorporated to enter the Indian Super Bike
                Market. Further from July 2013, IKM started assembly of Z250, Ninja 300, Ninja 650, ER-6N, and Versys
                650
                motorcycles at its plant located in the premises of its Indian partner, while the functions such as
                marketing, sales and after-sales services were taken care by Kawasakiâ€™s Indian partner.
                From September 2013, IKM also started marketing / distribution / after-sales service of Super Sports
                Bikes
                viz. Ninja ZX-14R, Ninja ZX-10R, Ninja 1000, Z1000, Z800 through its own dealers located in major cities
                in
                India. Off-Road Bikes such as KLX110, KLX140 were also introduced in Indian market.
                The successful alliance with Indian partner for sales and after-sales service of its motorcycles ceased
                with
                effect from April 01, 2017. This will strengthen and promote Kawasaki brand experience to customers in
                conjunction with Kawasaki Global Marketing.
